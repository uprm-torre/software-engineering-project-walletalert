WalletAlert – Project Proposal  
Summary  
WalletAlert is a budgeting app designed for college students who struggle to keep track of small daily 
expenses. Unlike complex finance apps, WalletAlert provides a lightweight, intuitive interface for logging spending, 
visualizing habits, and receiving al erts before exceeding a budget. The goal is to reduce overspending while making 
financial tracking simple and stress -free. 
Problem Statement  
The Problem: College students often overspend without realizing it, especially on small recurring purchases 
like coffee  and snacks. Existing finance apps feel overwhelming, cluttered, or time -consuming for users who just 
want the basics.  
5 Whys Analysis:  
Why do students overspend? → They lose track of small purchases.  
Why do they lose track? → They do not  record expenses consistently.  
Why don’t they record expenses? → Finance apps are too complex and time -consuming.  
Why are they too complex? → Most apps are designed for professionals with advanced needs.  
Why do students avoid them? → Because they need quick, minimal tools, not full financial planning systems.  
Target Users  
The primary target users are college students living on tight budgets. Secondary users include young adults 
or anyone seeking a minimalist alternative to traditional budgeting apps.  2 | P a g e  
 Proposed Solution  
WalletAlert offers  a painless way  to log expenses, track spending trends, and receive proactive alerts. The 
focus is on simplicity, speed, and clarity, not advanced accounting. By reducing the barriers to logging expenses, 
students will build awareness of their habits and make better fina ncial decisions.  
Core Features  
• Quick Expense Entry – Simple form (amount, category, date) with editable timestamps.  
• Summaries – Weekly and monthly breakdowns with clean graphs.  
• Budgeting & Alerts – General budgets and category budgets, with alerts when nearing or exceeding limits.  
Minimum Viable Product (MVP)  
• A working version of WalletAlert with:  
• Quick expense entry (amount, category, date).  
• Weekly and monthly summaries.  
• General budget with alert notifications.  
Stretch Goals  
• Category -specific budgets.  
• Exporting data (CSV/PDF).  
• Cloud sync across devices.  
Related Work  
• Copilot Money – Full-featured app, but complex for students seeking simplicity.  
• Mint (discontinued) – Popular budgeting tool but  cluttered with ads and extra features.  
• Manual tracking (spreadsheets, notebooks) – Simple but inconvenient.

 Wallet Alert  
 
Introduction:  
 The domain of this project focuses on providing an insight into the current way college students 
organize their expenses and track them all together. As part of the scope of th is document, we will cover 
the role  and description of the student. The scope is limited to only basic expense tracking methods for 
students , this excludes things such as taxes , annual expense planning, payment plans, income tracking, 
etc. 
Key Concepts  and Roles : 
• User : An individual currently enrolled in college . 
• Expense : A recorded transaction containing amount, date/time, and category.  
• Category: Classification  grouping used when certain items share similarities or become  
repetitive.  
• Budget: A spending limit defined by the  student, which is subject to change depending on other 
factors.  
Domain Rules /Assumptions : 
1.  Budget rules  
• Budgets cannot have negative values.  
• Budgets may be defined globally and optionally for specific categories.  
2.  Expense rules  
• Each expense must include at least an amount and a category.  
• Expenses cannot have negative values.  
• Every expense must belong to exactly one category.  
3. Category rules  
• Categories are predefined (e.g., Groceries, Takeout, Utilities, Electronics, Other)  
4. User  Rules  
•  A student must set a weekly budget  and not go over it . 
• Students  must record their expenses.  
 
 
  
   
 Process  (User Flow) : 
1. Students  set a weekly budget.  
2. Students record their expenses in a journal  based on amount, type and time.  
3. Students do a basic subtraction from the budget with their current expenses.  
4. Students use the subtracted amount to determine how much budget  is left.

   Use Case Model  
 
 
Use-Case Narratives : 
1. Set Weekly Budget  
Basic Flow:  
• Student logs into the application.  
• Student selects “Set Budget”.  
• Student enters the total weekly budget.  
• Students save  the budget.  
Alternative Flows:  
• Students enter  a negative budget: system shows an error and prompts for valid input.  
• Students set  budgets for specific categories: system applies to  both global and category -specific limits.  
• Student changes category -specific budgets after adding expenses: system recalculates alerts and balances.  
2. Add Expense  
Basic Flow:  
• Student logs into the application.  
• Student selects “Add Expense”.  
• Students enter  the expense amount.  
• Students select  or create  a category for the expense.  
• Students save  the expense.  
 
   
 • System updates the user’s balance and category totals.  
Alternative Flows:  
• Student enters an invalid amount (negative or non -numeric): system shows an error and prompts for valid 
input.  
• Student forgets to select a category: system prompts to assign a category.  
• Student wants to edit the date of the expense (default is today): student updates the date before saving.  
• Student edits a previously logged expense: system allows modification before finalizing totals.  
3. Respond to Budget Alert  
Basic Flow:  
• Students receive  an alert that spending is near or has exceeded the budget.  
• Students open  the alert.  
• Student reviews details (global budget or category -specific).  
• Student decides how to respond (adjust spending, update budget, etc..).  
Alternative Flows:  
• Students ignore  the alert: system continues tracking and will issue further alerts if needed.  
• Student modifies an expense after an alert: system recalculates totals and updates alerts.  
• Alert is triggered for a category -specific budget: system highlights the relevant category in the notification.  
4. View Summary Report  
Basic Flow:  
• Student selects “View Summary”.  
• System generates the report (weekly or monthly).  
• Student reviews total spending, remaining balance, and breakdown by category.  
Alternative Flows:  
• Students  request  a summary before the week/month ends system generates a partial report.  
• No expenses logged: system generates an empty summary with only the budget values.  
• Student deletes or edits an expense before generating the report: system recalculates totals and updates the 
summary.  
 
 
  
   
 Preliminary Prioritization:  
 1. Add and categorize expenses (Highest Priority):   
• This is the core functionality that enables all other features. Without the ability to log expenses, the system 
cannot function. Students need this basic capability before any analysis or monitoring can occur.  
2. Set Weekly budget (high priority)   
• Essential for establishing spending limits and enabling meaningful tracking, this provides the baseline 
against which all expenses are measured and is required for budget monitoring functionality.  
3. Monitor Spending and Alerts (High – Medium Priority)   
• Provides feedback to help students stay within their budget limits. The alert system is crucial for preventing 
overspending and achieving the primary goal of budget management .  
4. Generating Summary Report (Medium Priority)   
• Important reflection and analysis of spending patterns, but not critical for day -to-day budget management. 
Students can manually calculate totals if needed while this feature is being developed.  
MoSCoW categorization:  
1. Must Have:   
• Add and categorize expenses – System cannot function without this  
• Set Weekly budget – Required for meaningful expenses tracking  
2. Should have:   
• Monitor Spending and Alerts – Transforms passive tracking into active management.  
3. Could have:  
• Generating Summary Report – Valuable but not essential for core functionality.  
4. Won’t have:   
• Advanced analytics beyond basic summaries  
• Integration with external banking systems

3. Student skips category -specific budgets:  system only applies to  the global budget.  
Add and Categorize Expense:  
 
   
 Basic Flow:  
• Student logs into the application.  
• Student selects “Add Expense.”  
• Students enter the expense amount.

3. Student wants to edit a previously logged expense : system allows modification before 
finalizing totals.  
Monitor Spending and Alerts:  
Basic Flow:  
• Student logs expenses throughout the week.  
• System continuously updates balance and spending totals.  
• When spending reaches a predefined threshold, the system generates an alert.  
• If spending exceeds the budget, a different alert is generated.  
 
 
 
Alternative Flows:   
   
 1. Student ignores the alert:  system continues tracking and triggers additional alerts if limits 
are exceeded.  
2. Student modifies an expense after an alert : system recalculates totals and adjusts alerts 
accordingly.  
3. Alert is triggered for a category -specific budget : system highlights the relevant category 
in the notification.  
Generating  Summary Report:  
Basic Flow:  
• At the end of the week/month, the system automatically generates a summary report.  
• Report includes total spending, remaining balance, and breakdown by category.  
• Students  can view the summary within the app.  
Alternative Flows:  
1. Student requests a summary before the week/month ends: system generates a partial 
report.  
2. Students have no expenses logged : system generates an empty summary with default 
budget values.

===== Project Design Document =====

1. Introduction:  
Wallet Alert’s Purpose is t o provide  users a simple way to keep track of their expenses and to 
provide a visual queue when they are reaching a weekly budget or get notify when they go over it , 
we also allow the user to categorize their expenses and date as well. As part of our scope for this 
design we will focus on providing an interactive and easy-to-follow  process for users to input their 
expenses and visualize their budget . It is important to mention that it is not within our scope to 
include complex  mathematical expressions to calculate things like  taxes.

4. Class Diagrams:  
 
Class Descriptions:  
1. Student: Represents the user of the system who manages their expenses and 
budget.  
• Main Responsibilities : 
✓ Stores user’s name, weekly budget, and expense records  
✓ Records and views budget and expenses  
• Dependencies and Associations:  
✓ Has a one -to-many association with Expense  
✓ Has a one -to-one association with Budget  
• SOLID Principle:  
✓ Single Responsibility:  Is only responsible for storing and managing 
user-related financial data.  
  
2. Expense: Represents an expense made by a student.  
• Main Responsibilities:  
✓ Stores the amount, date, and category of each expense  
✓ Provides getters for the amount, date, and category of each expense  
• Dependencies and Associations:  
✓ Belongs to one Category  
✓ Associated with one Student  
• SOLID Principle:  
✓ Single Responsibility:  Is only responsible for representing an 
expense’s data  
  
3. Budget: Represents the amount limit that the student is willing to spend for a period 
or for a certain category.  
• Main Responsibilities:  
✓ Stores the total limit, the remaining amount, and the category specific 
limits  
✓ It updates the totals with each expense  
✓ Checks the total and category specific budgets  
• Dependenc ies and Associations:  
✓ Associated with one Student  
✓ Aggregates multiple Category budgets  
✓ Generate  alerts if needed  
✓ Interacts with Alert Service  to trigger notifications when limits are 
exceeded  • SOLID Principle:  
✓ Open/Closed:  Can be extended to support new budget types or time 
frames without modifying existing code  
  
4. Category: Represents the classification of an expense.  
• Main Responsibilities:  
✓ Stores the name of the classification  
✓ Provides a getter for the name of the classification  
• Dependencies and Associations:  
✓ One-to-many relationship with Expense  
✓ Associated with Budget if category -specific budgets are defined  
• SOLID Principle:  
✓ Interface Segregation : Only provides essential operations relevant to 
category handling without unnecessary methods  
  
5. Alert: Represents a notification that warns a student when the total expenses are 
getting near or exceeding  their set limit.  
• Main Responsibilities:  
✓ Stores the type, the message, and the triggered status for the 
notification  
✓ Provides functions to trigger or dismiss the notification  
• Dependencies and Associations:  
✓ Created and managed by Alert Service  
✓ Associated with Budget to determine when to trigger alerts  
• SOLID Principle:  
✓ Liskov Substitution:  Allows substitution by specialized alert types 
without breaking system functionality  
  
6. Alert Service : Handles the logic of sending alerts to the student based on their 
spending activity.  
• Main Responsibilities:  
✓ Checks alerts and notifies the student if a limit is getting reach or has 
been exceeded  
• Dependenc ies and Associations:  
✓ Depends on Budget  
✓ Aggregates multiple Alert objects to notify the student  
• SOLID Principle:  ✓ Dependency Inversion: Depends on rather than concrete 
implementations, enabling flexibility and testing  
 
5. Other Design  Considerations:  
 
• Design Patterns Used or Planned:  
 
✓ Singleton:  Ensures only one instance of a class exists while providing global 
access. Used for configuration management (settings, storage paths, 
notifications) to keep system behavior consistent.  
  
✓ Observer:  Allows multiple objects to receive updates when another 
changes. Used between Budget and Alert Service so alerts trigger 
automatically when spending approaches or exceeds limits.  
  
✓ Factory Method:  Provides an interface for object creation while letting 
subclasses decide the type. Used to create Expense, Alert, or Category 
objects dynamically, improving flexibility and scalability.  
  
• Technical Assumptions:  
 
✓ The system will only support student users, and all functionalities are 
designed with this profile in mind.  
  
✓ There will be no banking or financial account integrations, meaning the 
application does not process transactions or connect to external payment 
systems.  
  
✓ All data will be stored locally within the user’s device, ensuring privacy and 
offline functionality without the need for server communication or cloud 
storage.
