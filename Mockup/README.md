# WalletAlert Presentation Skeleton

This folder holds a bare-bones, static mock of the WalletAlert dashboard—ideal only the layout not without any real functionality.

## How to use
- Open `index.html` directly in a browser (double-click the file or drag it into a tab).
- Everything is static; no tooling, servers, or authentication are required.

## What's inside
- Lightweight header, dashboard cards, chart placeholder, recent activity list, and sidebar—just enough to explain the experience.
- Disabled controls and plain numbers to signal that interactions are illustrative only.
- Minimal CSS (`styles.css`) that keeps spacing, typography, and colors simple for early-stage demos.
